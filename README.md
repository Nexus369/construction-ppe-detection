# SafetyFirst — PPE Compliance Checkpoint

**Team Mojito** — original concept by **Jasbir Singh Monga**, built with
Bhavesh Waghmare and Priyal Vairagade.
Built for the FAR AWAY 2026 hackathon.

An access-control gate, not a monitoring dashboard. A worker presents an RFID
badge, a camera checks their PPE against the site's current policy, and the
gate either lets them through (recording attendance) or turns them away
(recording why, with a photo). Everything an admin can configure — what's
required, who's allowed, where the gate is — is a runtime setting, not a
redeploy.

This file is the map: what exists, how it fits together, how to run it, and
where it was left off. If you're picking this up cold (new machine, or
someone else on the team), read this section first, then the "Local setup"
section to get it running.

---

## Where things stand

**Working end-to-end**, verified against the real model and a real browser:

- Badge scan → worker lookup → live PPE check (YOLOv8: Hardhat, Safety Vest,
  Mask — see [Model limitations](#model-limitations)) → grant/deny → attendance
  record.
- A full admin console: overview, personnel (role filters, last-seen, CSV
  export), captures (evidence viewer), reports (CSV presets), analytics,
  checkpoint policy, site location, and an append-only change log.
- Configurable checkpoint policy (which PPE is required, confidence
  threshold) — takes effect on the next frame, no restart. All three
  surfaces (web dashboard, kiosk display, camera overlay) read the live
  policy instead of a hardcoded list.
- Evidence capture: refusals are photographed automatically (never grants —
  a deliberate privacy stance), snapshots are operator-triggered. Images
  auto-purge after 30 days; the decision record does not.
- An audit log for policy changes and personnel deletions — closes the
  accountability gap that making policy configurable would otherwise open.
- Live inference performance readout (FPS / latency) on the gate view.
- Spoken gate announcements ("Access granted.", "Put on your hardhat...") via
  ElevenLabs, cached on disk per phrase so a repeated sentence never pays for
  or waits on synthesis twice. Falls back to the browser's built-in voice
  with no configuration required — `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is optional.
- Site location: an admin-set point today, but the API and admin UI are
  already built to take a live fix the moment a GPS module is wired in (see
  [gps_reporter.py](pi_app/gps_reporter.py)) — no further backend changes
  needed when that hardware arrives.
- The Raspberry Pi checkpoint app (`pi_app/`) runs natively (not a browser),
  owns the camera and an MFRC522 RFID reader directly, and has a `doctor.py`
  pre-flight tool to diagnose a new Pi before trusting it at a real gate.
- A local attendance queue (`pi_app/offline_queue.py`) covering the one gap
  that mattered: a PPE check reaches a verdict, and then the network drops
  in the few seconds before that decision is recorded. That record is saved
  locally and retried automatically once the connection's back, instead of
  vanishing. This is not a full offline mode — badge lookup and the PPE
  check itself are both server-side, so if the connection is down before a
  verdict exists, there's nothing yet to lose.
- Sensor alerts: a critical alert (gas, etc.) holds the gate — it overrides
  PPE compliance entirely, since someone in full gear still isn't safe to
  admit into a hazard. It shows on the kiosk display, pauses the checkpoint
  app on the Pi even before anyone badges in, and pops up on every open
  admin/operator browser tab (polled, not pushed). An admin's **Alerts**
  page has the history and a "simulate" trigger for testing without real
  sensor hardware, which posts to the same endpoint the ESP32-main board
  will use once it exists — nothing here changes when it arrives.
- Threshold-based sensor readings: a device can report a raw value (e.g.
  gas ppm) instead of deciding severity itself — the backend classifies it
  against an admin-configured per-kind threshold (warning/critical level,
  unit, and whether higher or lower is worse) and raises the same alert a
  breach would. A kind with no threshold set just has its readings logged.
  Configured on the Alerts page, alongside a small live readout of the
  latest value per sensor. [`esp32-sim/`](esp32-sim/) can exercise this
  without any real sensor.

**A board per job, not one board doing everything** — five ESP32s, each
with a single responsibility, all reaching the Pi or something that does.
Two sensor nodes ([`ppe_sensors/`](esp32-main/ppe_sensors/)) read real
MQ-9 and DHT11 hardware and post to `/api/gate/alerts` and
`/api/gate/sensors`; two cameras ([`cctv_cam/`](esp32-main/cctv_cam/))
serve MJPEG on the LAN and are relayed to the console by the Pi; the gate
master ([`gate_master/`](esp32-main/gate_master/)) carries badges, hazard
packets and the cooling fan down one USB line.

Each sensor node is named with a `NODE_ID` that prefixes its readings
(`yard_gas` rather than `gas`), because the backend keeps one live row per
kind — two unnamed nodes would overwrite each other and the console would
show whichever spoke last. Naming them also buys per-node thresholds,
which is what you want anyway: a gas limit that suits the mixer is not the
one for an open yard.

[`esp32-sim/`](esp32-sim/) is kept as a hardware-free fallback — it signs
in identically and reports typed values, so the alert pipeline can be
demonstrated if a node's wiring fails at the venue.

**Designed, not yet built:**

**Untested on real hardware** — everything below has code but has never
touched actual hardware:

- The MFRC522 RFID reader (code is written including a same-badge-rescan
  fix; `pi_app/doctor.py` is ready to bring it up).
- Any GPS module (`pi_app/gps_reporter.py` supports NMEA-over-serial, e.g. a
  NEO-6M, but `SAFETYFIRST_GPS=off` is the default until one exists).
- The Waveshare UPS HAT (E) and its I²C fuel gauge.
- Local (on-device) inference via the AI HAT — see
  [Cloud vs. local inference](#cloud-vs-local-inference-deferred) below.

**Explicitly deferred, with reasoning kept here so it isn't re-litigated:**

### Cloud vs. local inference

Inference currently runs on the backend (cloud), not the Pi — keeps the Pi
install light (no torch/ultralytics on-device) and was cheap bandwidth-wise
when inference only fires while someone's actively being checked at a badge
scan. This gets revisited once the AI HAT is actually in hand and there's a
real benchmark to look at — a past project's experience with an AI HAT
underperforming on a similar pipeline is the reason for wanting a benchmark
before switching, not a bias against local inference. It also matters more
once multiple always-on cameras are added (continuous streaming, not just
per-badge checks) — that's a planned expansion, not yet configured.

### Why the model can't require gloves or boots

`best.pt` (YOLOv8) only has three classes: `Hardhat`, `Safety Vest`, `Mask`
(confirmed via `YOLO('best.pt').names`). The admin console's Checkpoint
Policy page only lets you require items the model can actually see —
requiring something it can never detect would refuse everyone, permanently.
Gloves/boots detection would need a retrained or additional model.

```

Three ways to hit the same backend: a browser (any operator/admin), the
Pi's own fullscreen native app (the actual gate), or the Pi's touchscreen
running the same web frontend in kiosk mode. All three read the same live
policy and write to the same database.

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT-Extended, SQLite (dev) /
  Postgres (production-ready via `DATABASE_URL`).
- **ML:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), OpenCV.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no framework, no build step. Tailwind
  and Font Awesome via CDN. Shared design tokens in `css/app.css`.
- **Pi app:** Python + Tkinter (native fullscreen UI, not a browser) +
  OpenCV for camera capture only (inference stays on the backend).
- **Auth:** JWT, email/password or Google Sign-In, plus a guest mode.

---

## Local setup

### 1. Backend

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

copy .env.example .env       # macOS/Linux: cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` — for local dev, `SECRET_KEY`/`JWT_SECRET_KEY` can be any random
string, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` can stay blank (email/password still works).

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

Listens on `http://localhost:5000`, creates `app.db` (SQLite) on first run.

Useful one-off scripts (run from `backend/`, with the venv active):

```bash
python make_admin.py you@example.com     # flag an account as admin
python seed_workers.py                    # create demo workers with fake badge IDs, for testing without a card reader
```

### 2. Frontend

No build step — just serve the static files (opening `index.html` as a
`file://` URL breaks camera access and Google Sign-In, which both require a
real origin):

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. If the API isn't on `localhost:5000`, edit
`frontend/js/config.js`.

### 3. Raspberry Pi checkpoint app (optional)

Only needed to run the actual native gate app (as opposed to the
browser-based Gate Control page, which works fine for development without
any Pi). Full instructions, including the RFID reader and GPS module setup,
are in [`pi_app/README.md`](pi_app/README.md). Short version:

```bash
cd pi_app
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # set SAFETYFIRST_API to the backend's LAN IP, not localhost
python doctor.py        # pre-flight check before trusting the gate
python checkpoint.py
```

---

## Environment variables (backend `.env`)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | `dev-secret-change-me` | Flask session secret — set a real random value in production |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | `dev-jwt-secret-change-me` | Signs auth tokens — same caveat |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///app.db` | Set to a Postgres URL in production — SQLite on an ephemeral container filesystem is wiped on redeploy |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | *(blank)* | Optional — see Google Sign-In setup below |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:8000,http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Comma-separated frontend origins allowed to call the API |
| `EVIDENCE_DIR` | `backend/instance/evidence` | Where refusal photos are written — point at a mounted volume in production |
| `EVIDENCE_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | How long refusal images are kept before auto-purge |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | *(blank)* | Optional — spoken gate announcements. Blank keeps the browser's own (robotic) voice; nothing breaks either way |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` | `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` ("Rachel") | Any voice_id from your ElevenLabs library |

Pi app env vars (`pi_app/.env`) are documented in
[`pi_app/README.md`](pi_app/README.md) and `pi_app/.env.example`.

### Setting up Google Sign-In (optional, 5 minutes)

1. [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application.
2. Add every origin you serve the frontend from under **Authorized JavaScript origins** (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`).
3. Put the Client ID in `backend/.env` (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`) and `frontend/js/config.js` (`window.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`). Restart the backend.

Email/password auth works with none of this configured.

---

## Deployment

The `Dockerfile` builds **one container serving both the API and the
console**, so there is a single public URL and the console needs no API
address configured — it uses its own origin. Works on Hugging Face
Spaces (the YAML frontmatter at the top of this file is already set up
for it), Render, Fly.io, or anything that runs a container.

**Two variables are required.** The app *refuses to start* on a known
host if they're missing, rather than serving traffic with signing keys
that are published in this repository:

```
SECRET_KEY          python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
JWT_SECRET_KEY      (a second, different one)
```

**Set `DATABASE_URL` too, in practice.** Spaces and Render have
ephemeral filesystems: the default SQLite file and every evidence photo
are wiped on each restart or redeploy, taking the compliance record with
them. Point it at managed Postgres and the decisions survive. Evidence
images still need a mounted volume (`EVIDENCE_DIR`) — without one, the
records outlive the photos they reference.

Optional: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GROQ_API_KEY` (help
chatbot), `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (spoken announcements), `CCTV_UPLOAD_TOKEN`
(lets a camera post frames when the gate device is off). Each is blank by
default and its feature degrades quietly rather than breaking.

`CORS_ORIGINS` is **not** needed for the single-container deployment —
same origin, so no cross-origin request happens. It only matters if you
host the console separately.

**Do not raise the gunicorn worker count.** The image pins `-w 1` and
uses threads instead. The process holds the latest frame from each CCTV
camera and each user's live detection state in memory; a second worker
gets its own copy, so frames posted to one become invisible to a viewer
served by the other. It fails intermittently and per-request. Moving that
state to Redis or the database is the prerequisite for scaling out.

**Split hosting still works** if you want the console on a CDN: deploy
`frontend/` anywhere static and either set `PRODUCTION_API` in
`frontend/js/config.js` or load it once with `?api=https://your-backend`
(remembered afterwards). Then `CORS_ORIGINS` must list that origin.

**What hosting does not solve:** the Pi and the ESP32 nodes reach the
backend *outward*, so they need its public URL in their config — but
nothing reaches *inward* to them. A cloud-hosted backend still cannot
fetch from a camera on the site's LAN, which is why the Pi relays camera
frames rather than the server pulling them.

---

## Hardware status

**Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)** — the site gateway, and the only box with a route
off site. Waveshare 10.1" touch display, Waveshare UPS HAT (E) (I²C fuel
gauge at `0x2d`, 4×21700 cells, ~4hr backup, 5V/6A out), AI HAT (Hailo, 12
TOPS — still not used for inference, see
[above](#cloud-vs-local-inference-deferred)).

**Five ESP32 boards**, all working, every one of them reaching the Pi or
something that does:

| Board | Firmware | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Gate master (ESP32 38-pin) | [`gate_master/`](esp32-main/gate_master/) | RC522 badges, ESP-NOW receiver, cooling fan on GPIO25/26 — all over one USB line to the Pi |
| Sensor node ×2 (ESP32-C3 SuperMini) | [`ppe_sensors/`](esp32-main/ppe_sensors/) | MQ-9 gas + DHT11 temp/humidity, each named by `NODE_ID` |
| Camera ×2 (ESP32-CAM) | [`cctv_cam/`](esp32-main/cctv_cam/) | MJPEG + snapshots; one OV2640, one GC2145 |

The sensors sit on their own boards deliberately, off the Pi's GPIO, so
sensor timing never competes with camera and badge work on the same chip.

The two cameras have **different sensors** and it matters: the OV2640
encodes JPEG in hardware, the GC2145 (sold as RHYX-M21-45) has no encoder
at all. One firmware covers both — it tries JPEG, catches the refusal, and
re-initialises in RGB565 with software encoding at a lower resolution.

**The fan is on the master, not the Pi**, because the AI HAT has no
temperature sensor and the Pi's own header is occupied. The Pi sends
`TEMP` down the same wire badges come back on; the master owns the curve,
so a crashed Pi makes the fan speed *up* rather than coast.

**GPS works.** A Vanix TracX-1b (Quectel EC200U) over USB gives a 3D fix
that reaches the console — see
[Site Location](#) in the admin console, and `pi_app/gps_reporter.py`.

`pi_app/doctor.py` walks the whole chain — platform, SPI, reader
libraries, camera, backend, credentials, policy, GPS — and says which link
is broken instead of leaving you to guess from a blank screen.

**Not compile-checked:** none of the four sketches, because there is no
`arduino-cli` on either machine. The fan has not yet been driven from this
firmware, and ESP-NOW has a receiver that has never been sent a packet.

---

## Model limitations

`best.pt` detects exactly three classes: `Hardhat`, `Safety Vest`, `Mask`.
It cannot detect gloves or boots — the admin console's policy editor only
offers items the model can see, on purpose (see
[above](#why-the-model-cant-require-gloves-or-boots)).
