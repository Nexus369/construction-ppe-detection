"""The master ESP32, over USB.

Sensor nodes talk ESP-NOW to a master board; the master is wired to the Pi by
USB and forwards everything down one serial line. That covers two kinds of
traffic which used to arrive separately — badge scans (previously an RC522 on
the Pi's own SPI header) and hazard reports (previously an HTTP POST) — so
this is a `BadgeReader` that also feeds the local alert store, rather than
two objects fighting over one port. Only one process can hold a serial
device open, so they could not be split even if it were tidier.

Line protocol, one message per line, verb first. Case-insensitive, and any
line that doesn't parse is ignored rather than logged — an ESP32 prints a
burst of bootloader noise at every reset, and treating that as an error
would fill the log each time the board is power-cycled:

    BADGE 0006238412
    ALERT gas critical fumes near the mixer
    READING gas 450 ppm

`READING` carries a raw value and is classified against the site thresholds
the roster sync caches, exactly as the HTTP receiver does — the same ppm has
to mean the same thing whichever way it reached the Pi.

The port is reopened if it disappears, so unplugging the master and plugging
it back in recovers on its own, matching how the camera behaves.
