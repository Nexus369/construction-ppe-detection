# SafetyFirst — Raspberry Pi Checkpoint

A fullscreen gate display that owns the camera directly and shows the
grant/deny ruling for whoever steps in front of it.

Running natively rather than in a browser removes every constraint a web page
carries at a gate: no HTTPS requirement for camera access, no cache, no kiosk
flags, no permission prompt — and a direct path to GPIO for the badge reader
(implemented — see below) and a lock relay (not built yet).

```
┌── Raspberry Pi ────────────┐        ┌── Backend ──────────────┐
│  camera → checkpoint.py    │ ─────► │  /api/socket → YOLOv8   │
│  fullscreen verdict display│ ◄───── │  verdict + detections   │
└────────────────────────────┘        │  record → database      │
                                      └──────────┬──────────────┘
                                                 │
                                      web admin & worker records
```

Inference runs on the **backend**, not the Pi, so this install stays light —
no torch, no ultralytics.

## Install (on the Pi)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-tk python3-venv
```

`python3-tk` is required — it is not bundled with Raspberry Pi OS's Python.

```bash
cd pi_app
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Badge reader (MFRC522, optional but recommended)

Without it the app falls back to typing tags on a keyboard — fine for
development, not for a real gate.

```bash
sudo raspi-config   # Interface Options -> SPI -> Yes, then reboot
pip install spidev RPi.GPIO mfrc522
```

Wiring (BCM): `SDA→GPIO8(CE0)  SCK→GPIO11  MOSI→GPIO10  MISO→GPIO9  RST→GPIO25  3.3V→3.3V  GND→GND`
(3.3V, not 5V — the module doesn't tolerate 5V).

### GPS module (optional, not required to run the gate)

Plug it in — there is nothing to configure. The Quectel TracX-1b this project
owns is found by its USB vendor id and switched on automatically. With no
module attached the checkpoint's location stays whatever an admin set by hand
in the console's **Site Location** page.

A plain NMEA module (a NEO-6M and friends) needs one extra package and an
explicit port, because nothing in USB descriptors distinguishes one of those
from any other serial device:

```bash
pip install pynmea2
```

then set `SAFETYFIRST_GPS_PORT` in `.env`. `SAFETYFIRST_GPS=off` disables
location entirely. See `gps_reporter.py`.

### How USB devices are found

The gate master ESP32 and the GNSS modem are both identified rather than
guessed at. The Pi lists USB serial ports, filters them by vendor id, and
then asks each remaining candidate who it is before trusting it — the master
answers `ID?` with its own name. Once found, a board is remembered by USB
serial number, so moving it to a different socket does not lose it.

This matters more than it sounds. The modem presents **seven** serial
interfaces. Taking "the first `/dev/ttyUSB*`" hands the gate one of those
instead of the master, and badge scanning stops working the moment location
is plugged in — with nothing in the logs to say why.

Nothing to set for any of this. `SAFETYFIRST_SERIAL_PORT` still pins a
specific port if you ever need to override the search. See `usb_devices.py`.

## Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Set `SAFETYFIRST_API` to a URL the Pi can actually reach — the backend
machine's LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.9:5000`), not `localhost`, unless the
backend runs on the Pi itself.

Create a device account through the web sign-up and put those credentials in
`.env`. Without them the app opens a guest session, which works but files
every decision against a throwaway account.

## Pre-flight check

Before trusting the gate — especially the first time on a new Pi — run:

```bash
python doctor.py            # everything except an actual card/GPS read
python doctor.py --scan     # also waits for a real badge scan and a GPS fix
```

It walks the chain from kernel to badge to backend (platform, SPI, reader
libraries, camera, backend reachability, device credentials, site policy,
GPS) and says which link is broken instead of leaving you to guess from a
blank screen at demo time.

## Run

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python checkpoint.py
```

Press **Esc** or **q** to exit.

While developing on a laptop, `SAFETYFIRST_WINDOWED=1` runs it in a normal
window instead of taking over the screen.

## Home screen icon

A gate is an appliance, so it can be opened like one — a hard-hat icon on the
Pi's desktop, no terminal and no command to remember:

```bash
cd pi_app
./install_launcher.sh
```

That adds the icon to the desktop and to the applications menu. Two variants:

```bash
./install_launcher.sh --autostart   # also open it at login, restarting on crash
./install_launcher.sh --remove      # take all of it back off
```

Run it as the desktop user, **not** with sudo — everything lands under `$HOME`,
and a sudo run installs the icon into root's home where nobody will see it.

Tapping the icon opens the gate fullscreen. Right-click it for two extra
actions: **Open in a window**, for setting the machine up, and **Run
diagnostics**, which is `doctor.py` in a terminal.

Because there is no console behind an icon, `launch.sh` puts failures on the
screen rather than into the void — a missing `python3-tk` named as such, a
crashed app with its last log lines, or a second copy being opened while one
is already running (which would otherwise fight the first over the camera and
the master's serial port). Everything it runs is appended to
`pi_app/checkpoint.log`.

## Start automatically on boot

`./install_launcher.sh --autostart` above is the simpler route and is enough
for a Pi that logs into its desktop. Use a systemd unit instead when the gate
should come up without anyone logging in, or when you want it supervised by
the init system rather than by the desktop session.

Create `/etc/systemd/system/safetyfirst.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=SafetyFirst Checkpoint
After=graphical.target network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/PPE-Detection/pi_app
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStart=/home/pi/PPE-Detection/pi_app/venv/bin/python checkpoint.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical.target
```

Adjust `User` and the paths if you are not on the default `pi` account, then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now safetyfirst
sudo journalctl -u safetyfirst -f     # watch the logs
```

`Restart=always` brings the checkpoint back up if it crashes or if the
backend was unreachable at boot.

## If the network drops mid-check

The backend stays authoritative — this isn't an offline mode, since both
worker identity and the PPE check itself are server-side. What it does
cover: a PPE check can finish and reach a verdict, and then the network
can drop in exactly the few seconds before that decision is recorded. When
that happens the attendance record is saved locally
(`offline_queue.db`, alongside `checkpoint.py`) instead of being lost, and
retried automatically every `SAFETYFIRST_QUEUE_FLUSH_INTERVAL` seconds
(default 15) once the connection is back. The status bar shows `N SYNCING`
while anything is queued. No deduplication — if a record happens to get
through right before the connection drops, replaying it is a harmless
double-write, which is cheaper than building idempotency for a report
field nobody reads twice. `python doctor.py` reports a non-empty backlog
as a warning.

## Sensor alerts

A critical alert (gas, etc.) holds the gate — it overrides PPE compliance
entirely, and this app shows it as a distinct amber "paused" state, not
the red "denied" one, since it isn't a ruling on whoever's at the badge
reader. It's checked even while idle (polled every 3s alongside the
on-site headcount), so the screen shows "Gate Paused" before anyone
badges in, not only mid-check.

No gas/smoke sensor is wired directly to the Pi — that hardware lives on
the (not yet built) ESP32-main sensor board, which will `POST` to
`/api/gate/alerts` once it exists. Until then, alerts only come from the
admin console's **Alerts** page, which has a "simulate" button hitting the
same endpoint — useful for testing this behavior without any hardware.

## Troubleshooting

**"Camera 0 not available"** — list what the Pi can see with
`v4l2-ctl --list-devices` (`sudo apt install v4l-utils`), then set
`SAFETYFIRST_CAMERA` to the right index.

**"Cannot reach the API"** — from the Pi, check
`curl http://<backend-ip>:5000/api/health`. If that fails it is the network or
a firewall, not this app. The backend must bind `0.0.0.0`, which `app.py`
already does.

**"Device credentials rejected"** — the email/password in `.env` do not match
an account. This deliberately does *not* fall back to guest, so the gate never
silently detaches from its named device account.

**Verdict never leaves "Step Up"** — the model has to see a `Person` before it
rules on anything. Check the detection log in the web admin console to confirm
frames are arriving.

## Notes

- The display runs at camera rate while inference is throttled to
  `SAFETYFIRST_INTERVAL` (0.5s default) — a person does not change PPE thirty
  times a second, and sending every frame would only load the API.
- Required PPE is set live from the admin console's **Checkpoint Policy**
  page (`backend/site_settings.py`), not hardcoded — the gate and the web
  dashboard read the same policy, so changing it takes effect on the next
  frame with no redeploy.
- Local (on-Pi) inference with the AI HAT is a future option; it needs the
  model converted `.pt → ONNX → HEF` with Hailo's compiler.
