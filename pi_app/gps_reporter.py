"""GPS reporting for the checkpoint device.

Three implementations:

  QuectelGPSReader  the Vanix TracX-1b (Quectel EC200U-CN), which is the
                    GNSS receiver this project actually owns
  SerialGPSReader   any NMEA-0183 module that streams unprompted on a
                    serial/UART port (e.g. a NEO-6M), via `pyserial` +
                    `pynmea2`
  NullGPSReader     no module attached — reports nothing

`open_gps()` picks the best available and falls back otherwise — same
shape as badge_reader.open_reader(), so a Pi with no module attached
still starts.

The EC200U is not a NEO-6M and SerialGPSReader cannot drive it. It stays
silent until `AT+QGPS=1` switches the receiver on, its UART runs at
115200 rather than 9600, and it presents several USB interfaces of which
only one answers AT commands. So it gets its own reader that asks for a
fix instead of waiting to be told one.

Ports are found by USB vendor id, never by walking /dev/ttyUSB* in
order. The gate master ESP32 is a CP210x sitting on that same list, and
writing AT commands at it would corrupt the badge stream that
serial_bridge.py is reading — the one wire the gate cannot afford to
lose. Filtering on the vendor id means we only ever open the modem.

The board enumerates seven interfaces and only some answer AT; the
others return binary diagnostics, nothing at all, or are already held by
ModemManager. Which number lands where moves with enumeration order, so
the usable one is found by asking rather than by being hardcoded.
