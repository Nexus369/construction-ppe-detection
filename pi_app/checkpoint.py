"""SafetyFirst — Raspberry Pi checkpoint application.

A fullscreen gate display. A worker presents a badge, the screen shows who
they are, the camera checks their PPE, and the gate either lets them through
and marks them present or tells them exactly what to put on.

Flow
    IDLE      waiting for a badge
    PROFILE   badge recognised — showing who this is, PPE check running
    GRANTED   cleared; attendance recorded; returns to IDLE on its own
    DENIED    turned away; Retry, or clear the gate for the next person

Running natively rather than in a browser removes the constraints a web page
carries at a gate: no secure-origin requirement for camera access, no cache,
no kiosk flags — and direct access to the RFID module over SPI.

    python checkpoint.py

Configuration comes from the environment (a .env beside this file works too):

    SAFETYFIRST_API         API base URL          (default http://localhost:5000)
    SAFETYFIRST_EMAIL       device account email  (optional)
    SAFETYFIRST_PASSWORD    device account passwd (optional)
    SAFETYFIRST_CAMERA      camera index          (default 0)
    SAFETYFIRST_INTERVAL    seconds between sends (default 0.5)
    SAFETYFIRST_READER      auto | mfrc522 | keyboard
    SAFETYFIRST_WINDOWED    set to 1 to disable fullscreen
    SAFETYFIRST_GPS         auto | off | quectel | serial   (default auto — plug and play)
    SAFETYFIRST_GPS_PORT    serial port for the GPS module (default /dev/ttyUSB0)
    SAFETYFIRST_GPS_INTERVAL  seconds between location reports (default 20)
    SAFETYFIRST_QUEUE_FLUSH_INTERVAL  seconds between retrying queued attendance records (default 15)
    SAFETYFIRST_CCTV_URL    site camera on the local network, e.g.
                            http://safetyfirst-cam.local (blank = no camera)
    SAFETYFIRST_CCTV_INTERVAL  seconds between relayed frames (default 1.0)
