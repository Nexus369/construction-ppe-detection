"""Presentation layer for the checkpoint display.

Tkinter gives you flat grey boxes unless you take it somewhere, so this
module owns the visual system: tokens, type scale, bordered surfaces, pill
rows and the small amount of motion the screen actually needs.

Motion policy follows the same rule as the web console — animate only what
carries meaning. A gate display is watched, not operated, so the two things
that move are the ones a person is waiting on: the confirmation progress
while PPE is being verified, and the countdown before the gate clears.
