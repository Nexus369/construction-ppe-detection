/*
  SafetyFirst — gate master (ESP32, USB-wired to the Raspberry Pi)

  Reads badges from an RC522 and forwards them to the Pi over USB serial.
  Also listens for ESP-NOW packets from the sensor nodes and forwards those
  down the same wire, so the Pi has one input to read instead of several.

  Line protocol — one message per line, verb first. This is what
  pi_app/serial_bridge.py parses; anything else is ignored, so ordinary
  debug printing is harmless.

      BADGE 0006238412
      ALERT gas critical fumes near the mixer
      READING gas 450 ppm
      FAN 62 2480                 duty percent, measured RPM

  The wire runs both ways now. From the Pi:

      TEMP 54.8 1.35              CPU temperature °C, load average
      FAN 70                      pin the fan at a duty percent
      FAN AUTO                    hand it back to the curve

  Anything else in either direction is ignored, so ordinary debug
  printing stays harmless on both sides.

  Wiring (RC522 -> ESP32 38-pin), the VSPI defaults:

      3.3V -> 3V3       SDA/SS -> GPIO5     SCK  -> GPIO18
      GND  -> GND       MOSI   -> GPIO23    MISO -> GPIO19
                        RST    -> GPIO22    IRQ  -> unused

  Cooling fan (4-pin), on the same board because the AI HAT has no
  temperature sensor and the Pi's own fan header is occupied:

      PWM  -> GPIO25    25kHz control
      TACH -> GPIO26    open-collector, pulled up internally

  The fan's supply and the ESP32 must share a ground, or the tach reads
  nothing and the PWM does very little.

  RC522 runs at 3.3V. It is not 5V tolerant.

  Library: "MFRC522" by GithubCommunity (Arduino Library Manager).

  BADGE FORMAT — the important bit. The Pi's Python reader (SimpleMFRC522)
  turns a card UID into a decimal integer from the first four UID bytes,
  big-endian, and the worker records were created from those values (e.g.
  0006238412). This sketch reproduces that exactly, zero-padded to ten
  digits. Printing hex, or all seven bytes of a 7-byte UID, yields a string
  that matches no worker and reads at the gate as "badge not recognised" —
  a wrong answer that looks like a correct one.

/* ---- Cooling fan ----------------------------------------------------

   This board also drives the Pi's fan, because the AI HAT has no
   temperature sensor of its own and the Pi's own header is occupied. The
   Pi sends its temperature and load down the same USB line the badges
   come back on; this decides a duty cycle and reports the measured RPM.

       Pi  -> master:   TEMP 54.8 1.35
       master -> Pi:    FAN 62 2480

   Why the curve lives here rather than on the Pi: the dangerous failure
   is a fan that stops while the Pi cooks. If the decision were made on
   the Pi, a crashed or busy Pi would simply stop asking for airflow and
   the fan would idle at whatever it was last told - exactly when it is
   least safe. Here, silence is treated as a fault: after FAILSAFE_MS
   with no update the fan goes to FAILSAFE_DUTY rather than staying put,
   because an unreachable Pi is more likely to be a hot one than a cold
   one.

   Wiring (4-pin fan):
       PWM  -> GPIO25      control, 25kHz
       TACH -> GPIO26      open-collector, needs a pull-up
       12V/5V and GND from the fan's own supply, grounds tied together
