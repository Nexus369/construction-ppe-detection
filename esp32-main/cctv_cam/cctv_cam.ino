/*
  SafetyFirst CCTV camera — an ESP32-CAM serving a live MJPEG stream on
  the LAN. A second pair of eyes on the site, separate from the gate: the
  checkpoint camera is busy deciding who gets in, and pointing it at the
  yard instead would mean choosing between the two.

  This board does not talk to the backend at all, and holds no
  credentials. It serves frames to whoever asks on the local network, and
  the Pi relays them onward (pi_app/cctv_relay.py -> backend/cctv.py) so
  the browser never connects to the camera directly. That split is
  deliberate:

    - The ESP32 does what it is good at (capture and serve) and nothing
      it is bad at. TLS plus a JWT refresh loop on a board with this much
      RAM buys latency and crashes, not security.
    - Access control stays in one place. The console already knows who is
      an admin; the camera would have to be taught, badly.
    - It keeps the camera off the public internet. Only the Pi beside it
      needs a route, and a camera down a shaft has no other route anyway.

  The corollary is that this camera is unauthenticated on its own
  network. Anyone on that WiFi can watch it by IP. Treat the network as
  the security boundary, and do not put this on a guest or public SSID.

  TWO SENSORS, ONE SKETCH
  -----------------------
  These boards ship with different camera modules and the difference is
  not cosmetic:

    OV2640            has a hardware JPEG encoder. Frames come out ready
                      to send, so VGA at a useful rate is cheap.
    GC2145            (sold as RHYX-M21-45 / M12-45) has no JPEG encoder
                      at all - only RGB565/YUV/RAW. Every frame must be
                      compressed in software on the CPU, which is slow,
                      so it runs at QVGA.

  Rather than keeping two sketches or a #define nobody remembers to
  change, this initialises optimistically in JPEG mode and falls back to
  RGB565 with software encoding if the sensor refuses. The Serial log
  says which sensor was found and which path is in use, because "the
  picture is slow" and "the picture is missing" have very different
  causes on these two parts.

  Endpoints (identical whichever sensor is fitted):
    /           a one-page status/preview, handy for proving it works
    /stream     multipart MJPEG - the live feed
    /snapshot   a single JPEG - what the Pi's relay polls

  Setup:
    1. Arduino IDE -> Boards Manager -> install "esp32" (Espressif).
       No extra libraries: esp_camera and esp_http_server ship with it.
    2. Copy secrets.h.example to secrets.h and fill in WiFi and CAM_ID.
       Gitignored, same pattern as ppe_sensors and alert_sim.
    3. Tools -> Board -> "AI Thinker ESP32-CAM".
       Tools -> Partition Scheme -> "Huge APP (3MB No OTA)". The default
       does not fit and the upload fails late, after compiling, with a
       size error that reads like a code problem.
    4. Flashing needs a USB-TTL adapter - this board has no USB port:
         adapter 5V->5V, GND->GND, TX->U0R, RX->U0T
         jumper IO0 to GND, press RESET to enter the bootloader
       Remove the jumper and press RESET again to run. "Failed to
       connect" is almost always IO0 not grounded when the upload starts.
    5. Serial Monitor at 115200 to see the sensor and the address.

  Power is the thing that actually bites. This board browns out on a weak
  5V supply the instant the radio transmits - it shows up as a boot loop,
  or a stream that dies a few seconds in, and looks like a firmware bug.
  Use a supply good for 500mA+ and short wires. Many USB-TTL adapters
  cannot deliver that from their 5V pin.

/* Change resolution and JPEG quality without reflashing.

   Espressif's own CameraWebServer exposes this, and for good reason: the
   right frame size is a property of the link, not of the code. Measured
   here, VGA cost about 28KB a frame and the sensor managed 9.6 of them a
   second; QVGA is nearer a quarter of that and roughly doubles the rate.
   Which you want depends on whether you are watching over the LAN or
   through a tunnel on a phone hotspot, and that can change between one
   demo and the next.

   Deliberately not persisted. A camera that quietly keeps a setting
   somebody tried once is worse than one that returns to a known state
   when power-cycled - board_*.h stays the single source of truth.

/* ---- Optional: post frames to the backend without the Pi -------------

   Normally the Pi relays this camera, which is the better path: it holds
   a real device session and this board holds no credentials at all. But
   a camera whose only route out is through the Pi vanishes entirely
   while the Pi is off or rebooting, and "the yard is invisible because
   the gate restarted" is poor behaviour for a monitoring feed.

   With BACKEND_URL and UPLOAD_TOKEN set in secrets.h, the camera also
   posts for itself on a slow timer. When the Pi is up its faster relay
   simply overwrites these, so the two paths need no coordination — the
   console always shows whichever frame arrived last. When the Pi is
   down, this keeps the tile alive.

   The token is not a login. It can do exactly one thing, replace this
   camera's picture, which is about as much as should ever live in the
   flash of a board sitting on an open LAN.
