/*
  SafetyFirst ESP32 sensor node — reads real hardware: an MQ-9 gas sensor
  on an analog pin, a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor on a digital pin.
  Same sign-in-then-POST pattern as esp32-sim/alert_sim.ino (see that
  file's header for the fuller explanation) — that sketch stays put as a
  hardware-free fallback. If this board's wiring breaks at the venue and
  you still need to demo the alert pipeline, flash alert_sim.ino instead;
  nothing on the backend cares which one is talking to it.

  Wiring:
    MQ-9   VCC->5V  GND->GND  AOUT->10k->[node]->10k->GND, [node]->GPIO0
           (the divider halves AOUT's ~5V swing to a safe ~2.5V max, inside
            the ESP32-C3's ADC input range). DOUT unused, left unconnected.

    DHT11  VCC->5V  GND->GND  DATA->GPIO4
           (the bare 4-pin sensor also needs a 10k pull-up from DATA to
            5V; the 3-pin breakout module already has one built in, so
            skip it if that's what you have)

  Gas is reported in millivolts, not ppm. A raw MQ-9 has no ppm without
  Rs/R0 calibration against a known reference gas concentration, which
  nobody doing this at a hackathon actually has on hand — reporting the
  honest unit is the defensible choice over fabricating a number that
  looks precise but isn't. Once you've watched a few minutes of clean-air
  baseline in Serial Monitor, set a real threshold on the Alerts page
  above that baseline, with its unit changed to "mV" (it's currently
  configured for "ppm" from testing with the simulator — that number and
  unit no longer mean anything against a real reading).

  Serial Monitor commands (115200 baud, newline line ending):
    gas                     critical gas alert (manual trigger, /api/gate/alerts)
    smoke                   critical smoke alert (no smoke sensor wired; manual only)
    warn                    a non-critical warning (doesn't hold the gate)
    reading <kind> <value>  a raw value, e.g. "reading gas 450" — same path
                            the automatic sensor readings below use
    auto                    toggle automatic reporting: real MQ-9 gas (mV)
                            and real DHT11 temperature/humidity, read and
                            posted every few seconds
    status                  reprint WiFi/sign-in state

  Setup:
    1. Arduino IDE -> Boards Manager -> install "esp32" (Espressif Systems).
    2. Library Manager -> install "ArduinoJson" (by Benoit Blanchon, v6.x).
    3. Library Manager -> install "DHT sensor library" (by Adafruit). It
       will prompt to also install "Adafruit Unified Sensor" as a
       dependency — accept that too, both are required.
    4. Copy secrets.h.example (same folder) to secrets.h and fill in real
       values. Gitignored, so a real WiFi password never ends up in the
       tracked .ino — same pattern as esp32-sim/alert_sim.
    5. Tools -> Board -> ESP32C3 Dev Module. On an ESP32-C3 SuperMini also
       set USB CDC On Boot -> Enabled, or Serial Monitor stays blank.
    6. Upload, then Tools -> Serial Monitor, 115200 baud, line ending
       "Newline".

  API_BASE must be your PC's LAN IP (e.g. http://192.168.1.9:5000), not
  localhost or 127.0.0.1 — the ESP32 is a separate device on the network.
  Both need to be on the same WiFi, and the backend must be running.

/* ---- Optional: report via the gate master instead of WiFi -----------

   Define REPORT_VIA_ESPNOW in secrets.h to send readings and alerts to
   the gate master over ESP-NOW, which forwards them to the Pi on its USB
   line. This is the arrangement for a node with no network of its own -
   down a shaft, inside a tunnel, or simply out of range of the site AP.
   The Pi is the only box with a backhaul, and this puts the sensor
   behind it like everything else.

   THIS IS EITHER/OR, NOT A FALLBACK, and the reason is physical. The
   master deliberately never joins an AP so it stays on a fixed channel.
   A node that joins WiFi is moved to the router's channel by the radio,
   and ESP-NOW between two channels silently does nothing - no error, no
   packet, just a sensor that appears to work and reports to nobody. So a
   node either joins WiFi and posts over HTTP, or stays off WiFi and
   talks to the master. Trying to do both is how you get the quiet
   failure.

   Set MASTER_MAC to the address the master prints at boot:
       # ESP-NOW ready, mac 24:6F:28:AA:BB:CC, channel 1
   and ESPNOW_CHANNEL to the channel on that same line.

/* ---- Node identity ---------------------------------------------------

   With more than one sensor node on a site, every reading must say which
   node it came from, and the place that has to carry it is the kind
   itself. The backend keeps one live row per kind (SensorReading, keyed
   on kind alone), so two nodes both reporting "gas" overwrite each other
   and the console shows whichever spoke last with no sign there are two.

   Qualifying the kind - "yard_gas" rather than "gas" - fixes that
   without a schema change, and gets something better than a fix for
   free: thresholds are configured per kind, so each node can have its
   own. A gas limit that makes sense beside the mixer is not the one you
   want in an open yard.

   Alerts were never lost either way; every report is evaluated as it
   arrives. It is the live readout that was misleading.
